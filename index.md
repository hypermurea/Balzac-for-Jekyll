I offer freelance software consultancy at a high level. With over 15+ years of experience in software, I can help you achieve software outcomes and improve future capabilities.

As a consultant my focus is 100% on fulfilling client requirements. Customers who I deal with receive what they need, and I provide a money-back guarantee for the quality of my work.

I work in whatever role is suited for deliver results, and can help you in both macro- and micro-scale software needs.

#### Macro

When software needs high-level direction I can help in the appropriate role:

* Software architect
* Manager and project driver
* Technical lead

I have a successful history of architecting high-demand large scale systems and managing teams that deliver them.

#### Micro

I have been hobbyist programmer since age 10. I have experience with both low-level languages down to assembly language up to modern high-level languages.

After over a decade of professional programming I still love it. Experience has given me a good understanding of the program structures that lead to maintainable high-quality software.

I can leverage my expertise as a lead developer to guide effective development and help the whole team get better. My feeling is technical work should be led from the front, and everyone and anyone should let work and colleagues teach them daily.

### Will jump for these

I am always searching for novel problems to solve. In the right setting I am also very interested in technical leadership roles as a partner with the possibility of future equity.

Right now I am very attracted to these:

* Technical leadership roles as a partner with equity
* Machine learning projects
* Opportunities to learn and apply pure functional programming (Haskell, Erlang, Clojure)
* Interesting technical problems

### Mandatory keywords

On the technical stack I employ whatever is suitable for the case in question. I have been learning and applying numerous different software technologies for 15+ years, and gaining knowledge is always a plus. Some past keywords that come to mind right now:

fullstack, programming, architecture, web development, javascript, node.js, angular, frp, bootstrap, jekyll, cordova, phonegap, mobile apps, Java, Groovy, Grails, continuous integration, docker, kubernetes, AWS, Azure, serverless, machine learning, AI, python, keras, tensorflow, numpy, databases, SQL, oracle, mysql, postgres, mongodb, redis etc

### Contact

I am always open for discussion about interesting work or casual networking. Contact me!
